Given an arraylist and two Strings, this project searches the strings in the arraylist.
For the result to be true, both of the strings have to be present in the arraylist. 
If either of the Strings are present or neither, then the method returns false.

Words written (in seperate lines) in the left box will be added into the arraylist
First line of the right box is for the first String to be searched in the arraylist and the second line is for the second String. 

Pressing the submit button will display the result above the boxes.
